Built-into the DSR-1500A VTR is the i.LINK interface, which is based upon the IEEE1394 (DV, Firewire) standard. The i.LINK enables a single cable to simultaneously carry digital video and audio signals, as well as data and control signals with virtually no quality degradation. This simple connection offers an ideal solution for connecting the DSR-1500A with i.LINK interface equipped compatible nonlinear editing systems and other computer-related products. Make sure that you hit the SET button after changing any of the settings. The display should read "Saving..." and then exit the menu. | **LOCAL/REMOTE switch:** If the LOCAL/REMOTE switch is set to REMOTE, the  COUNTER SELECT button does not operate while the  tape is moving. In this case, make the time data selection  via the external equipment connected to the REMOTE  connector on the rear panel.  |

Furthermore, it is not possible to play back the cue-audio track of the tape. --from operation manual |
