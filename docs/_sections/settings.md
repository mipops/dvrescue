# Capture

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/settings_1.png"><img alt="Settings 1" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/settings_1.png"></a>\\

## Frame Filtering

## Timeout

Specify how long capture will continue if tape contains no data. This is helpful if you know a lot of your tape has no content and you don't want to monitor it to end capture.

## Retakes

During capture, DVRescue will automatically rewind and try to recapture segments of tape that have errors. This would reduce the need to capture the entire tape multiple times and merge takes. You can limit the number of times it will attempt to re-capture a section. Note that this feature is still new and experimental.

# Analysis

## Frame Table Display - Simple

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/settings_2.png"><img alt="Settings 2" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/settings_2.png"></a>

The frame table appears on the bottom right of the Analysis screen. The simple display shows the default pieces of information in the table.

## Frame Table Display - Advanced

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/settings_3.png"><img alt="Settings 3" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/settings_3.png"></a>

Here you can customize fewer or more options to see in the frame table.

# Advanced

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/settings_4.png"><img alt="Settings 4" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/settings_4.png"></a>

## Specify Tool Locations

If the dvrescue CLI installation or dependencies such as ffmpeg, mediainfo, or xmlstarlet are located in a nonstandard location, you must specify it here.
